I'm not depressed. I feel really good at the moment - maybe a bit overwhelmed by being actually busy for the first time in a while - but such societal hoardings make me check myself. I'm not the type to judge. I don't give a fuck. I strive to help - maybe this put me in certain sticky situations. Nonetheless, it makes me feel pretty good. 
She asked for the first time in a while something that isn't related to what I paid for - it felt heartless. Sounds like a love story - it's arguably not, maybe just platonic. Emotional transfer is brain fuckery.
Micro house is growing more and more on me. Used to hate it with passion. Maybe it was Her that influenced this upon me. The only conflict that happened this year. Used to live very conflictually - many friends, much trouble. Now I find myself embedded in loneliness and hoping for the best to come. Stopped forcing myself into anything. It surely was Her. I loved the joviality. I always thought she gave 0 fucks about anything. So soothing, it's something I couldn't ever achieve. I fell for the unachievable as well.
