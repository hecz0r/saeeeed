I'm not depressed. I feel really good at the moment - maybe a bit overwhelmed by being actually busy for the first time in a while - but such societal hoardings make me check myself. I'm not the type to judge. I don't give a fuck. I strive to help - maybe this put me in certain sticky situations. Nonetheless, it makes me feel pretty good.
