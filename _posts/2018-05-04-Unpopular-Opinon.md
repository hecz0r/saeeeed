We're a bunch of hypocrites. We're living in a state of mind that obstructs our unique way of thinking. We obide to social rules because of shear fear of social stigma, yet we struggle to be really creative. We're quick to marginalise, even if we empathised. We second guess our prinicples when we face uncertainty. We can't relate. We use a philosophical system that we call everytime we feel emotion.
They killed us. They didn't want us to feel; they wanted us to obide and pray.

It's saddening how artists are judged so quickly by social media, yet people just analyze their work sparringly, superficially. I couldn't see in Kanye anything more than a by-product of our own stigma. They persecuted him. They harrased him. Even if this is a call for popularity, his "slavery of the mind" declarations are in no shape or form false, but a classical way to look at ideology. Zizek called this a form of us "putting on" some ideology glasses, as we think in terms of brands and stereotypes. 

It's evidently cringe. It's shouldn't be such a popular topic, but what my struggle is to understand why people are so quick to judge and correct. Almost like we'd have a intrinsic burning desire for helping one-another, but it'd only trigger whenever we'd get something out of it. We love to shame West for attention grabbing, but we dearly love the attention that we receive for being people with "better" principles than him.
