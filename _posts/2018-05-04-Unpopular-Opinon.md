We're a bunch of hypocrites. We're living in a state of mind that obstructs our unique way of thinking. We abide to social rules because of shear fear of social stigma, yet we struggle to be really creative. We're quick to discriminate, even if we empathetic. We second guess our principles when we face uncertainty. We can't relate. We use a philosophical system that we call every time we feel emotion.

_They killed us. They didn't want us to feel; they wanted us to abide and pray._

It's saddening how artists are judged so quickly by social media, yet people just analyze their work sparingly, superficially. I couldn't see in Kanye anything more than a by-product of our own stigma. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeA7lvC1ego) persecuted him. [They](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeA7lvC1ego) harassed him. Even if this is a call for popularity, his "slavery of the mind" declarations are in no shape or form false, but a classical way to look at ideology. [Zizek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVwKjGbz60k) called this a form of us "putting on" some ideology glasses, as we think in terms of brands and stereotypes. 

**It's evidently cringe.** It's shouldn't be such a [popular topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=986e_jOx4qc), but what my struggle is to understand why people are so quick to judge and correct. Almost like we'd have a intrinsic burning desire for helping one-another, but it'd only trigger whenever we'd get something out of it. We love to [shame West](https://www.highsnobiety.com/2017/10/02/kanye-west-fat-shaming/) for attention grabbing, but we dearly love the attention that we receive for being people with "better" principles than him.
