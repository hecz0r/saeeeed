_I hate Her so much._
I think I'm developing a mild form of OCD. I'm of the opinon that life is a tangent function, and whenever given x equals pi/2 shit goes down. It's such a beautiful representation; it's a periodic function, it ranges throughout all the real numbers, yet such an infinitesmal amount is crucial for it's definiton.
_I love Her so much._
Life's about balancing whatever's good or bad. You're given a stopwatch, a compass and a pen. The stopwatch is usually broken - it's up to you to repair it and clock in a lap, or maybe stop it for a moment - until you have to meticulously repair it again. A very addictive circle if you ask me. The compass is naturally calibrated, at least you don't have to worry about that, and then there's this pen. Such a horrible asset if you ask me! It's unreliable. It doesn't help you use it at all. It's really complicated, few can even use it. Most of us just toss ink at a piece of paper - takes too much practice and patience to write beautifully.
_I don't feel Her anymore._
Maybe you get over these existential crises. You will come up with the same conclusion. It doesn't matter who is pi/2. X is equal with pi/2 every period of the tangent function. All of a sudden, north and south switch up on the compass and time flows backwards - or do they? It's merely a matter of perspective. Maybe you were looking at them wrong the whole time, but now you bounced back to your senses. Ironic. You desire what you can't achieve, and only because of that reason. Everything else is an illusory.
